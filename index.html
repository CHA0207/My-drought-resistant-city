	<p>This is my drought resistant city above. There is a water tank in the middle of the city, the long tall bricks are buildings, and everything is connected to the tank through pipes. The pipes will obviously be underground, but for the purposes of this 3d model, the pipes are shown. The water in the tank is collected when it rains and other methods can be employed such as if there is a river nearby or geothermal water can be collected. In the case of a drought, the lid of the tank will be closed to prevent evaporation. Below is a labelled diagram as to how everything will work.</p>
